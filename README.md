# Fraud & Risk Analytics Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Saim — a fraud strategist and data analyst with 5+ years of experience leading FinTech initiatives. This repository showcases a suite of analytics projects built with Python, SQL, and Streamlit, all geared toward tackling real-world fraud and risk management challenges.

As the lead on these projects, I’ve driven everything from architecture to execution, focusing on scalable insights and operational impact.
